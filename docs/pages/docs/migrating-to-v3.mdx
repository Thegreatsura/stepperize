# Migrating to v3

Stepperize v3 brings with it a number of naming changes to make the pattern. 
It also adds a `switch` method that allows to render in a simpler way the components we want for each step.

## Breaking Changes

### Name changes in the values returned by the hook

The values returned by the `useStepper` hook have been renamed to make the pattern more consistent.

- `currentStep` is now `current`.
- `isFirstStep` is now `isFirst`.
- `isLastStep` is now `isLast`.
- `getStepById` is now `get`.
- `goToNextStep` is now `next`.
- `goToPrevStep` is now `prev`.
- `goToStep` is now `goTo`.

## New Features

### New `switch` method

The `switch` method has been added to the `useStepper` hook. This method allows us to render the components we want for each step in a simpler way.

```tsx
const MySteps = () => {
  const stepper = useStepper();

  return (
    <>
      {stepper.switch({
        "first": (step) => <p>This is the {step.title} step.</p>,
        "second": (step) => <p>This is the {step.title} step.</p>,
        "last": (step) => <p>You have reached the {step.title} step.</p>,
      })}
    </>
  )
}
```

### Add `all` property

The `all` property has been added to the object returned by the `useStepper` hook. This property contains all the steps in the stepper.

```tsx
