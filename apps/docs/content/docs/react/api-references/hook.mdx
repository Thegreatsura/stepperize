description: Access and control your stepper with the useStepper hook
---

The `useStepper` hook provides methods to interact with and render your stepper. It can be used with or without the [`Scoped`](./scoped) component.

## Usage

```tsx
import { defineStepper } from "@stepperize/react"

const { useStepper } = defineStepper(
  { id: "first" },
  { id: "second" },
  { id: "last" },
)

const MyStepperComponent = () => {
  const stepper = useStepper()
  // Use stepper methods here
}
```

## Rendering Methods

### when

The when method allows rendering content conditionally based on the current step. 
It can take an id of a step (either a string or an array of a step ID followed by booleans) 
and a whenFn (the function to execute if the step matches). Additionally, you can provide 
an optional elseFn (the function to execute if the step does not match).

```tsx
const MyStepperComponent = () => {
  const stepper = useStepper()

  return (
    <>
      {stepper.when("first", step => <p>First step: {step.title}</p>)}
      {stepper.when("second", step => <p>Second step: {step.title}</p>)}
      {stepper.when("last", "Finished!", "Not finished yet")}
    </>
  )
}
```

You can define more complex conditions that not only depend on the current step's ID 
but also on additional boolean values. This allows for multi-condition logic where each 
boolean must evaluate to true for the step to match. The boolean values can represent 
different state conditions or external factors that affect the step's visibility or behavior.

> The first element of the array is the step ID, the following elements are the boolean values.

```tsx
const MyStepperComponent = () => {
  const stepper = useStepper()

  const condition1 = ... // boolean
  const condition2 = ... // boolean
  
  return (
    <>
      {stepper.when(["first", condition1, condition2], step => <p>First step: {step.title}</p>)}
      {stepper.when("second", step => <p>Second step: {step.title}</p>)}
      {stepper.when("last", "Finished!", "Not finished yet")}
    </>
  )
}
```

### switch

The switch method allows you to render content based on the current step's ID, 
similar to a switch-case structure. This method provides a cleaner and more scalable 
way to handle different step-specific rendering logic, making it ideal for scenarios 
where you need to differentiate the UI depending on the current step without writing 
multiple when conditions.

```tsx
const MyStepperComponent = () => {
  const stepper = useStepper()

  return (
    <>
      {stepper.switch({
        first: step => <p>First: {step.title}</p>,
        second: step => <p>Second: {step.title}</p>,
        last: () => <p>Finished!</p>,
      })}
    </>
  )
}
```

### match

The match method allows you to render content based on an external state, 
such as a value fetched from a server or any dynamic state in your application. 
This provides flexibility for rendering content that is tied not only to the 
current step in the stepper but also to any other state outside the stepper's 
context, such as user actions, data from an API, or global application state.

```tsx
const MyStepperComponent = () => {
  const stepper = useStepper()
  const state = "Value from server or client state"

  return (
    <>
      {stepper.match(state, {
        first: step => <p>First: {step.title}</p>,
        second: step => <p>Second: {step.title}</p>,
        last: () => <p>Finished!</p>,
      })}
    </>
  )
}
```

<Callout type="info">
`match` allows state-based control from client or server, useful for frameworks like Remix with server-side state management.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| all | `Step[]` | Returns all steps |
| current | `Step` | Returns the current step |
| isLast | `boolean` | Returns true if the current step is the last step |
| isFirst | `boolean` | Returns true if the current step is the first step |
| next | `() => void` | Advances to the next step |
| prev | `() => void` | Returns to the previous step |
| get | `(id: string) => Step` | Returns a step by its ID |
| goTo | `(id: string) => void` | Navigates to a specific step by its ID |
| reset | `() => void` | Resets the stepper to its initial state |
| when | `(id: string, whenFn: (step: Step) => React.ReactNode, elseFn?: (step: Step) => React.ReactNode) => React.ReactNode` | Executes a function based on the current step ID |
| switch | `(steps: { [id: string]: (step: Step) => React.ReactNode }) => React.ReactNode` | Executes a function based on a switch-case-like structure for steps |
| match | `(state: string, steps: { [id: string]: (step: Step) => React.ReactNode }) => React.ReactNode` | Matches the current state with a set of possible states and executes the corresponding function |
