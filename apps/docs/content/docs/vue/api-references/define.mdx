`defineStepper` is the core function for creating a customizable stepper. It generates the necessary components and composables for building your stepper UI and managing its state.

## Usage

    ### Import

    ```tsx twoslash
    import { defineStepper } from "@stepperize/vue";
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Define steps

    Call `defineStepper` with your step configurations:

    ```tsx twoslash
    import { defineStepper } from "@stepperize/vue";

    const { Scoped, useStepper, steps } = defineStepper(
      { id: "step-1", title: "Step 1", description: "First step" },
      { id: "step-2", title: "Step 2", description: "Second step" },
      { id: "step-3", title: "Step 3", description: "Third step" }
    );
    ```

    - `id` (required): Unique identifier for each step
    - Add any custom properties (e.g., `title`, `description`) for use in your UI

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Return Value

`defineStepper` returns an object with:

- `Scoped`: A Provider component for scoping stepper state
- `useStepper`: A custom composable for accessing and controlling the stepper
- `steps`: An array of the defined step objects
- `utils`: Pure utility functions for working with steps
