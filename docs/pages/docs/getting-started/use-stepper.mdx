# useStepper Hook

As we saw in the previous section, the `useStepper` hook provides access to the actions needed to interact with the stepper.
It can be used with or without the [`Scoped`](./scoped-stepper.mdx) component, but in this case it will be used without Scoped.

If you want to know how to use the stepper with the `Scoped` component, you can read the section [Scoped Stepper](./scoped-stepper.mdx).

## Usage

```tsx
import { defineStepper } from "@stepperize/react"

const { useStepper } = defineStepper(
  { id: "first" },
  { id: "second" },
  { id: "last" },
)

const MyStepperComponent = () => {
  const stepper = useStepper()

  return (
    <p>{
      stepper.when("last", "Finished!", "Not yet...") // "Finished!" | "Not yet..."
    }</p>
  )
}
```

### When utility

One of the most interesting properties of the hook is the `when` property that allows you to render a component when the stepper is in a specific step.
Also, you can use the `when` with the third parameter to render a component when the step `is not` in a specific step.

## API Reference

The `useStepper` hook returns an object with the following properties:

<PropsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: "isLastStep",
      typeSimple: "boolean",
      description: "Check if the current step is the last step",
    },
    {
      name: "isFirstStep",
      typeSimple: "boolean",
      description: "Check if the current step is the first step",
    },
    {
      name: "goToNextStep",
      type: "() => void",
      typeSimple: "function",
      description: "Allow to go to the next step",
    },
    {
      name: "goToPrevStep",
      type: "() => void",
      typeSimple: "function",
      description: "Allow to go to the previous step",
    },
    {
      name: "goToStep",
      type: "(id: string) => void",
      typeSimple: "function",
      description: "Set the current active step by ID",
    },
    {
      name: "currentStep",
      typeSimple: "Step",
      description: "The current active step",
    },
    {
      name: "reset",
      type: "() => void",
      typeSimple: "function",
      description: "Reset the stepper to the first step or initial step",
    },
    {
      name: "when",
      type: "(id: string, whenFn: (step: Step) => React.ReactNode, elseFn: (step: Step) => React.ReactNode): React.ReactNode",
      typeSimple: "function",
      description: "If you want to render a step, you can use the `when` function. It takes a step ID and returns an object with a `render` method, allowing you to render the step when it matches the given ID.",
    },
    {
      name: "getStepById",
      type: "(id: string) => Step",
      typeSimple: "function",
      description: "Get a step by its ID",
    },
