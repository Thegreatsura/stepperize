# Stepperize
 
Stepperize is a library that allows to create a Stepper component in a simple and fast way.

The aim is to facilitate the creation of Steppers in web apps, allowing developers to focus on the business logic and not on the implementation of a Stepper.

<Callout type="info">
  Initially, the library is oriented to React, but it is expected that the community can contribute with implementations for other frameworks such as Vue, Angular, Solid, Svelte, Astro, etc.
