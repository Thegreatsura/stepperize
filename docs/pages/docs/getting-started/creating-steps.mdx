# Understanding the steps

We call `Steps` each step of the Stepper. These steps require certain information in order to be identified and inferred by typescript.

Each `Step` is only required to have a unique `id`. This `id` is used to identify the `Step` in the global and local state of each step.

There are two ways in which steps can be created:

1. By using the `createSteps` helper.
2. Creating the steps manually

<Callout type="info">
You can view the `Step` Type [here](/docs/components-and-hooks/stepper#step-type)
</Callout>


## Using the `createSteps` helper
 
<Steps>
### Import the helper
 
```tsx
import { createSteps } from "@stepperize/react";
```
 
### Create the steps
 
```tsx
const steps = createSteps([
  { id: "step-1", title: "Label 1", description: "Description 1" },
  { id: "step-2", title: "Label 2", description: "Description 2" },
  { id: "step-3", title: "Label 3", description: "Description 3" },
  { id: "step-4", title: "Label 4", description: "Description 4" },
] as const);
```
</Steps>

<Callout >
  Note the importance of adding the `as const` in the array of steps. This is necessary so that typescript can correctly infer the types of the steps.
  If you don't add the `as const` everything will work the same, but you just won't get typescript's autocomplete when you want to access the steps.
</Callout>

## Creating the steps manually

If you don't want to use the helper you can also do it manually in this way:

```tsx

import type { Step } from "@stepperize/react";

const steps = [
	{ id: "step-1", title: "Label 1", description: "Description 1" },
	{ id: "step-2", title: "Label 2", description: "Description 2" },
	{ id: "step-3", title: "Label 3", description: "Description 3" },
	{ id: "step-4", title: "Label 4", description: "Description 4" },
] as const satisfies readonly Step[];
```
