# Scoped Stepper Component

The `Scoped` component is a versatile and customizable component that allows you to create step-based workflows in your React application

Internally it works with the `Context` API so we can use the `useStepper` hook in any child component.

## Usage

Here is an example of how to use the `Scoped` component:

```tsx
import { defineStepper } from '@stepperize/react'

const Stepper = defineStepper(
	{ id: 'step-1' },
	{ id: 'step-2' },
	{ id: 'step-3' },
)

const MyApp = () => {
	return (
		<Stepper.Scoped>
			<MyHeader />
			<MyContent />
		</Stepper.Scoped>
	)
}

const MyHeader = () => {
	// synced with stepper from MyContent
	const stepper = useStepper()
}

const MyContent = () => {
	// synced with stepper from MyHeader
	const stepper = useStepper()
}
```

## API Reference
