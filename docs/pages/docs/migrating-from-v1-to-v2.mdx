# Migrating from v1 to v2 Guide

Stepperize v2 is a complete rewrite of the original Stepperize library. It comes with a few breaking changes and new features.

## Breaking Changes

### defineSteps helper

The `defineSteps` function has been removed. Use `defineStepper` instead.

```tsx
const Stepper = defineStepper(
  { id: "step-1", title: "Label 1", description: "Description 1" },
  { id: "step-2", title: "Label 2", description: "Description 2" },
  { id: "step-3", title: "Label 3", description: "Description 3" },
  { id: "step-4", title: "Label 4", description: "Description 4" }
);
```

Also, `defineStepper` only requires one id for each step and the type `Step` no longer 
has any other value, since you can send it anything else in favour of automatic inference.

For more information, see the [defineStepper](/docs/define-stepper) section.

### Stepper Provider

The `Stepper` component has been removed. Use `Scoped` from `defineStepper` object instead if you want to use with 1 or more Scopes of steps.

- We don't need to pass the array of steps to the component anymore.
- The `Stepper` component only accepts one prop, `initialStep`, which is the initial step to be active initially.

```tsx
const { Scoped } = defineStepper(
  { id: "step-1", title: "Label 1", description: "Description 1" },
  { id: "step-2", title: "Label 2", description: "Description 2" },
  { id: "step-3", title: "Label 3", description: "Description 3" },
  { id: "step-4", title: "Label 4", description: "Description 4" }
);
```

For more information, see the [Scoped Stepper](/docs/scoped-stepper) section.

### useStepper hook

The `useStepper` hook has been removed. Use `useStepper` from `defineStepper` instead.

```tsx
const { useStepper } = defineStepper(
  { id: "step-1", title: "Label 1", description: "Description 1" },
  { id: "step-2", title: "Label 2", description: "Description 2" },
  { id: "step-3", title: "Label 3", description: "Description 3" },
  { id: "step-4", title: "Label 4", description: "Description 4" }
);
```

For more information, see the [useStepper](/docs/use-stepper) section.
