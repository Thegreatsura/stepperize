# Understanding the steps

The idea behind the library is that we can define our IDs which will identify each step
 and is the most important value that we can work with and create our own steps. 
 You will be able to see this in action later on

## Creating our steps

In order to create our steps we need to import the `defineSteps` helper from the library.
 
<Steps>
### Import the helper
 
```tsx
import { defineSteps } from "@stepperize/react";
```
 
### Create the steps
 
```tsx {8}
const steps = defineSteps(
  { id: "step-1", title: "Label 1", description: "Description 1" },
  { id: "step-2", title: "Label 2", description: "Description 2" },
  { id: "step-3", title: "Label 3", description: "Description 3" },
  { id: "step-4", title: "Label 4", description: "Description 4" },
);

type Steps = typeof steps;
```
</Steps>

This value will be the one we will use to identify each step in the stepper and we will pass it to the 
Stepper component to provide us with all the logic we need to build our Stepper.

<Callout type="info">
  If you notice, we are using the `typeof` operator to get the type of the steps. This type can be used with the `useStepper` hook to provide us with the correct type safety.
