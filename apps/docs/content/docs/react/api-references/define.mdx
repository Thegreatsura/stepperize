  ### Define steps

  Call `defineStepper` with your step configurations:

  ```tsx
  const { Scoped, useStepper, steps } = defineStepper(
    { id: "step-1", title: "Step 1", description: "First step" },
    { id: "step-2", title: "Step 2", description: "Second step" },
    { id: "step-3", title: "Step 3", description: "Third step" }
  );
  ```

  - `id` (required): Unique identifier for each step
